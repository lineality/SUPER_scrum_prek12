# SUPER_scrum_prek12 + Liberal Arts

(under construction)

# Purpose, Goal, Problem to Solve
This is a set of tools and standards for constructing curricula (that will support the creation of lessons, courses, and evaluations) that will cover multiple important areas of skills that are valuable for work and life. 

## Areas to Integrate:
1. Problem solving skills (using the S.U.P.E.R. framework)
2. Team coordination skills for projects (Scrum & Agile)
3. Liberal Arts breadth content spanning such disciplines as: culture and traditions, stories and storytelling, history, literature, civics and governance, economics, arts, social skill, business, health, a cross section of sciences, etc. 

## Cross-Reinforcing
Combining the different skill sets and the clear contexts that come from real world content areas can cover the gaps and weaknesses that become problems when trying to teach each area alone in abstraction.
- Liberal arts content often lacks interactivity and applicability (-> SUPER & Scrum)
- Team coordination assumes problem solving skills (-> SUPER)
- Problem solving skills assume team coordination (-> Scrum)
- Both problem solving and team coordination are just hypothetical without a concrete situation and specific content which best connects to real life (-> Liberal Arts content)

When all the above areas are brought together, there is interactivity and applicability with clear problem solving, tangible team coordination, and all rooted in real world content.
